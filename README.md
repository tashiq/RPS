#Rock Paper Scissor
An Android studio application that identifies three hand gestures: rock, paper, and scissors. We all are familiar with how it works and who wins when. Sounds simple right? Yes, it is. The hard part of this application is to integrate a machine-learning model. That's what makes it different. I have used a Teachable-Machine model to identify gestures.
