# Rock Paper Scissor

An Android studio application that identifies three hand gestures: rock, paper, and scissors. We all are familiar with how it works and who wins when. Sounds simple right? Yes, it is. The hard part of this application is to integrate a machine-learning model. That's what makes it different. I have used a Teachable-Machine model to identify gestures. 
# Steps
I've gone through a lot of steps. Since it is an undergraduate project, you may think some of them are not efficient. Here are a few,
1. Project proposal
2. Dataset collection
3. Data preprocessing
4. ML model selection
6. Training
7. Evaluation
